# dogs-vs-cats-image-classification

This is a repo to show my dogs vs cats model. It is an image classification model that uses the residual network architecture and was made with tensorflow. Along with that i made an app that uses this model so you can see the output easily on mobile devices.

### Dataset

Here is a [Kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) link for the dogs-vs-cats dataset used. The Dataset contains a total of 25 thousand images of varying sizes, split equally between cat and dog classes.

### Installation

To Develop the app- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and open the folder inside Android Studio or an ide of your choice.

To modify the model's source code- have python and the used libraries installed on your system and open the code in any ide.

## Usage

Download the Apk file and run on your Android Phone or Tab.
